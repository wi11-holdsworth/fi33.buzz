## FizzBuzz?

The name is derived from a (very simple) interview screening technique called [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#Programming).

## Ethos

I've been following the advice described in [Plain Vanilla Web](https://plainvanillaweb.com/index.html) for no particular reason other than passive interest in vanilla web dev.
