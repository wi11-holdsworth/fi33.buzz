welcome!

the static site generator i'm using to kickstart this blog[1] requires a single post to exist in order to compile, and failing to provide a post sends `make` into an infinite loop.

so without further ado here it is, my first post!

topics to expect once i get myself more organised:

- basic tutorials on setting up self-hosted nixos web services
- lazy hardware reviews
- software shenanigans
- anything else i feel is relevant and useful to the wider web

thanks for stopping by ^.^
